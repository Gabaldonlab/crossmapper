# crossmapper

Crossmapper is an automated bioinformatics pipeline for asessing the rate of read crossmapping when two or more organisms are sequenced as one sample. The software can be used for planning such kind of experimental set-ups as dual- or multiple RNA-seq (mainly for host-pathogen, symbiont and cohabitant interaction studies), metagenomics studies, allele-specific expression studies, and can be extended for the use in large sequencing facilities for resource optimization.

Based on in-silico read simulation and back-mapping to the original genomes/transcirptomes of sequenced organisms, Crossmapper allows the users to assess the rate of errorneous multi- and crossmapping of reads to non-corresponding genomes and thus helps to optimise the sequencing parameters such as read lenght, paired/single-end, mapping parameters, etc., in adavnce to minimize the crossmapping rates.

# Instalation and setup
We have implemented the Crossmapper in python 3 as an Anaconda package. Thus, the Crossmapper installation is as easy as any other Anaconda package, whithout a need to solve any dependency issues. The exemplified procedure of Crossmapper instalation can be found in out step-by-step tutorial.
